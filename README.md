# Pet Pals - A Social Media App for Pets

## Description

A social media app for pet owners to connect, chat, and find play dates.

This project was thought of because we are all pet owners and thought it would be a neat idea to create a social media app where users can connect and arrange play dates for their pets.

This app is a one stop solution for pet owners that want to connect with other like minded pet owners.
